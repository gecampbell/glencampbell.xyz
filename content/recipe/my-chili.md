As everyone knows, chili was invented in Texas, probably as a way of consuming
older, tougher, possibly rotten cuts of meat. By slowly cooking over a long 
period of time, the meat grows tender and absorbs the complex flavor of the 
spices. 

Note that the red coloring of chili comes from, well, chilis. True Texas chili 
does not have tomatoes, nor does it have beans. (There is a remotely-related dish called "chili with beans," but it has no place in proper cuisine.)

## Ingredients

* 1-1.5 lb lean ground meat
* 1 onion, chopped
* 5 T. chili powder
* 1 T. garlic powder
* 1 T. black pepper
* 2 T. smoked paprika
* 2 T. flour

## Directions

* Brown meat and add chopped onions, then move to the slow cooker. 
* Add all the spices and enough water to cover, then stir thoroughly.
* Add salt if needed. 
  (If you like it extra spicy, add cayenne pepper as desired.)
* Cook all day on low, stirring occasionally and adding water if needed.
* About 30 minutes before serving, make a paste with the flour and a
  little bit of water, then stir that into the pot (this helps thicken
  the broth).

Serve with toppings: fresh chopped onions, shredded cheese, jalapenos,
crackers. If you're from deep east Texas, serve over rice.
