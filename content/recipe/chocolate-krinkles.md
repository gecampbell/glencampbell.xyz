While you can make these using regular cocoa powder, I've found
that Hershey's [Special Dark
cocoa](https://www.hersheys.com/pure-products/details.aspx?id=5354) is
wonderful.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 4 eggs
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar

## Directions

This is a refrigerator dough, so you can make it up the night before
you cook it and keep it in the refrigerator overnight.

### Step 1
1. In a medium bowl, mix together cocoa, white sugar, and vegetable oil. 
1. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. 
1. Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into the cocoa mixture.
1. Cover dough and chill for at least 4 hours.

### Step 2
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
1. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.
1. Roll dough into one inch balls. (You can use a melon baller for this, 
   as the dough is quite sticky.)
1. Coat the balls in confectioner's sugar before placing on the mats.
1. Bake in preheated oven for about 12 minutes.
1. Let stand on the cookie sheet for a minute before transferring to wire racks to cool.

I find that they come out slightly chewy, almost like a brownie.
If you prefer crispy cookies (heathen!) then you might cook them
a bit longer.
