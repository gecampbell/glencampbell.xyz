Buttermilk pie is a southern favorite, and I love the not-too-sweet
flavor and custard texture. It's similar to chess pie, but chess pie uses
cornmeal instead of flour.

## Ingredients

* 3 eggs
* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1-1/2 cups sugar
* 3 T. unbleached flour
* 1 cup buttermilk
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 T. lemon juice
* (optional) 1/2 tsp. grated nutmeg
* 1 9" unbaked pie crust

## Directions

* Preheat oven to 350&deg;F (175&deg;C)
* Beat eggs until frothy; add butter, sugar and flour. 
  Continue mixing until smooth.
* Stir in buttermilk, vanilla, lemon juice and nutmeg. 
  Personally, I don't care for nutmeg, so I leave it out. 
* Pour into the pie crust. 
* Bake about an hour, or until a knife in the center comes out clean. 
  For some ovens, that could be as soon as 40 minutes, but it's always
  a whole hour for me.
