We have a bread machine that we sometimes pull out and use.
It will make a 2lb loaf, which is very large for a bread machine,
so it can be cumbersome to set up and use. 
Since we've moved into our new house, it's been in storage for a few months
and then in a closet, so I got it out last night to make some
simple white bread (our favorite
<abbr title="Butter Delivery Vehicle">BDV</abbr>).
Since most of the recipes are for a smaller loaf, I adapted this one
to make a full-sized loaf.

## Ingredients

* 10 oz warm water[^1]
* 2 teaspoons yeast (1 packet)
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1‚ÅÑ2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 4 cups white flour

## Directions

* Put hot water, yeast and sugar in your bread machine.
  Let it stand for 10-15 minutes depending on the temp of your water.
  The yeast will foam.
* Add remaining ingredients.
* Use rapid or basic white cycles. 

[^1]: For dry yeast, the water should be about 110&deg;F. If it's too hot, it will kill the yeast.
