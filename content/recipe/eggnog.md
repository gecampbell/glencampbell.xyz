+++

Eggnog, when properly prepared, can be a wonderful 
accompaniment to a holiday gathering.
(It can also be used to light fires when the power goes out.)
This recipe was <s>stolen</s>adapted from Alex Scrivener on 
[FriendFeed](http://isfriendfeeddeadyet.com).

## Ingredients

* 4 cups Blended Whiskey (preferably Canadian)
* 2 cups Brandy
* 1 cup dark Jamaican Rum
* 1 cup light Puerto Rican Rum
* 1 dozen eggs
* 1 pound sugar
* 1 quart whole milk
* 1 quart heavy cream

## Directions

* Separate eggs.
* Whisk sugar and yolks together until smooth.
* Pour in liquor slowly, whisking constantly.
  This will cook the yolks, so if they aren't whisked smooth 
  with the sugar you will have bits of yellow floating in the nog.
* Add dairy, still whisking.
* Beat egg whites to soft peaks, then fold in.
* Let sit in the fridge for 24 hours.

Serve with fresh-ground nutmeg on top in very small glasses.[^1]

**WARNING** Do not let this get near an open flame.

[^1]: I can't emphasize enough that the glasses should be small. Very, very small.
