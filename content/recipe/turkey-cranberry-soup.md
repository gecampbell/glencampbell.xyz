Here's a great way to use up that leftover turkey and such from 
Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. 
Or just make it on its own; it's really wonderful. 

## Ingredients

* 1 cup cooked wild rice
* 4 T. unsalted butter
* 2 carrots, finely chopped
* 2 celery sticks, finely chopped
* 1/2 cup onion, finely chopped
* 3 cups stock (vegetable or chicken)
* 3 T. all-purpose flour
* 1 cup cranberries (fresh or dried)
* 2 cups cooked turkey, cut into small cubes
* 1 cup whole milk or half-and-half
* salt & pepper to taste

## Directions

* Melt the butter in a soup pot and add the mirepoix 
  (carrots, celery, and onion). Saut&eacute; over low heat
  until soft and translucent.
  I used a food processor to make sure that it was very smooth. 
* Whisk together the stock and flour; pour into the soup pot
  along with the vegetables.  
* Add the wild rice and cranberries and 
  cook until it thickens (5-10 minutes).
* Add the turkey, then cover and simmer over very low heat for
  about 15 minutes. 
* Before serving, add the milk or half-and-half and stir
  until it's thoroughly warmed through, then season to taste.
