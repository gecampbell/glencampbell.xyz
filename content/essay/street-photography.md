This morning, I happened to see two of my Facebook friends' posts side-by-side
in my newsfeed. Both of them are photographers with a heavy emphasis on
street photography, and both of them are quite good.

[Nia Maria Moilanen](http://www.saatchiart.com/neya) is based in Helsinki,
Finland, and though her work focuses primarily on self-portraits, she also
does some fabulous street work.
[Knut Sj√¶rven](http://oneverystreetphotography.wordpress.com/) is an old
friend that I've known for many years. He and I used to work together on
the Contax G pages, a site we ran that was dedicated to the Contax G
series cameras. He's a huge influence in the world of street photography
and is currently working on exhibitions in Europe and a street photography
summit in Copenhagen next summer.

Street photography is a genre that I love;
[Henri Cartier-Bresson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Cartier-Bresson)
is one of my key influences for why I became personally interested in
photography (along with
[Ansel Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams)).
The best street photography captures the accidental geometry and
artistry that appears when large groups of people are together in an
urban setting.

Alas, I am a child of the suburbs. I've never had much opportunity to engage
in street photography except on those rare occasions when I get to travel.
Quite frankly,
[suburban photography](http://500px.com/photo/75560051/suburbia-4th-of-july-by-glen-campbell?from=user_library)
simply doesn't have the impact of life in the big city.
