I have been traveling on business fairly regularly since 1993, when
I became a consultant for Evolutionary Technologies International,
an enterprise software vendor. When I first became a consultant, I
went out and spent $50 on a wheeled carryon bag. After a month, it
was utterly decrepit, so I replaced it with another $50 wheeled
carryon, but of a different brand. After another month on the road,
that bag, too, was destroyed.

Instead of spending another $50 on a wheeled carryon, I asked my
fellow consultants what they were using. Six of the seven were using
[Briggs & Riley](http://www.briggs-riley.com) wheeled carryons. The
B&R carryon cost $250, but it's hard to argue with results.

I can take a hint and, twenty-one years later, my Briggs & Riley
wheeled carryon is still going strong. A few years ago, one of the
wheels broke, but the company replaced it for free under their
unlimited lifetime warranty. Between 1996 and 2000, I lived in
Europe and averaged 140 flight segments per year. I don't travel
nearly so much these days, but I can still reply on my luggage.

I am not a paid spokesperson, but simply a very happy customer. I
have not performed an exhaustive comparison between B&R and other
brands, and I'm sure that the price has gone up since then. All I
know is that their products perform superbly.
