It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime event, at least for me. I don't
expect to be around when the next one occurs in 2117. It started
around 5PM Central Time, so I set up my little Celestron spotting
scope on a table on my back deck and projected the image of the sun
onto a piece of paper. The first indication was a little blob (Note:
because I'm projecting the image, it is upside-down and reversed
from the actual orientation.) on the bottom-left of the sun:

After about 20 minutes, I went back outside and checked again, and
Venus had moved perceptibly away from the limb of the sun:

(You can also see a trio of sunspots in this image.) All in all,
it was a very exciting experience, and one I was able to share with
my son.
