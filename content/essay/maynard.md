Welcome to The Maynard. We look forward to having you visit this year. Please take note of the following information so that we can all have a great time. It's an honor to be permitted to use this grand old property, and we have a responsibility to take care of it so that others can enjoy it.

> **Sorry, no pets permitted (no exceptions)**

### Dates

TBD

### Recreation

The lake is stocked and people have been catching tons of bass and perch. <em>Make sure that you have a valid Texas fishing license.</em> The Parks &amp; Wildlife people do drop by on occasion, and you don't want to end up paying a hefty fine. You'll need to bring your own fishing gear (rubber worms are always exciting to the bass). Fishing is catch &amp; release only!!

We do not have authorization for hunting, so please no rifles.

There's an area of the lake for swimming but it's not a swimming pool, so you may want to have aqua shoes or the equivalent. Feel free to bring your inflatable raft or other pool toys, but keep an eye on them in case they drift downstream.

It goes without saying that the west Texas sun can get HOT so please bring plenty of sunscreen.

If you want to go hiking on the ranch, that shouldn't be a problem, but please don't go onto other people's land without their permission. If you'd like to do an overnight stay (tent camping), that can be arranged, but let us know in advance so we can plan for various locations.

If you want to bring a guitar, ukulele, or just your voice, feel free! Maybe a board game or a deck of cards, too.

General rule of thumb: leave a gate how you found it. If it's closed, leave it closed. If it's open, leave it open.

Sonora Caverns is about 40 miles west of the ranch; it has some of the most beautiful cave formations around.

### Household

Bedding, pillows, and towels are provided. Please plan on doing laundry and remaking your beds on the day you leave. It would also be helpful to vacuum your room if possible. Feel free to bring along your favorite pillow if you prefer. <em>Please bring your own towels for swimming.</em>

The house has a central air-conditioning system supplemented by window A/C units in some of the rooms.

Most of the beds are twin beds with the exception of one bedroom. First come, first served.

In the main house, there are two bedrooms downstairs connected by a shared bath. Upstairs, there's a master bedroom with two twin beds and a bathroom, another common bathroom, and bedrooms with 1, 2, and 4 twin beds each. There's a guesthouse next door with two bedrooms and a bathroom that we can use should we overflow the main house. If someone has mobility issues, please let us know in advance and we'll make sure they get a downstairs bedroom.

You'll almost certainly be sharing a bathroom and shower with someone else, so plan for that. Please bring your own soap and shampoo.

There is an HDTV and satellite receiver, though I don't know for certain that it works. The TV works, however, so bring an HDMI cable if you want to play videos.

### Kitchen and Groceries

To make things easier, Anita and Glen will provide 2% milk, half-and-half, Splenda, and coffee for use by everyone. We have a Keurig individual coffee maker, so we'll bring an assortment of coffees. (If there's something special you want, feel free to bring it along.)

There is a grocery store in Junction; you should probably plan on stopping there to pick things up if you don't want to carry perishables a long way from home.

Depending upon what time you arrive, you may want to get supper in Junction on the first day. Isaak's Restaurant is good, and there are various fast-food places (Sonic, Dairy Queen, McDonald's) and a couple of excellent BBQ places (Lum's in town is particularly good; Cooper's on the Interstate is also good).

The kitchen has two refrigerators and a very small freezer. There should be plenty of room for your refrigerated stuff, but we probably can't handle tons of frozen goods. There's a large freezer in the barn, but we're not sure what it has in it.

There is a commercial-grade griddle, 6-burner cooktop, and two ovens, all gas-powered. The house has utensils, cups, etc., but you might want to bring a canteen or Camelback for carrying around liquids outside. There is a dishwasher for cleaning things after meals.

The house has a fair number of knives, utensils, and cookware. HOWEVER, if there's something special you need, you'll probably need to bring it along. (Note: there are at least two cast-iron skillets.) For example, if you want to make that extra-special bundt cake, then you'll want to have a bundt pan for it.

The ranch has a commercial-grade icemaker; if you bring an ice chest, we can keep it full of ice for soft drinks, beer, etc.

### Meals

We're thinking of having the evening meals (and perhaps lunches, too) all together; if we have one person/couple volunteer to provide the main course, then perhaps everyone else could prepare a side dish? What are your thoughts?

Bring what you want/need for breakfast and snacks.

### Telephone and Internet

There is no Internet service. You can occasionally get a cell signal if you step outside the house or drive up the road towards the interstate.

The phone number of the main house is available on request. Feel free to share it with folks.

### Directions

Find your way to Junction, and then head west on Interstate 10 to Roosevelt (about 15 miles).

Take the Roosevelt exit, and turn Right into town. The road will curve to the left through town, go up a hill, and end up next to I-10 at a stop sign.

At the stop sign, turn left and take the crossover to the other side of the Interstate, then turn Right.

You're now on the South side of I-10, heading West&mdash;this is effectively the access road. Proceed west almost exactly a mile, and you'll see an orange gate on the left (the gate should be open) with a sign to the Maynard Ranch. Turn in here (by the way, if you call us when you reach Junction, we'll drive up and meet you here and guide you in).

Follow this (paved) road until you reach the GR Ranch entrance, at which point you'll turn right onto the unpaved road.

The unpaved portion will go another mile or so, and fork; take the Left fork (I believe it's labeled Maynard Ranch, too).

This last little section goes about a quarter of a mile (and it's pretty rough, so go slow), then crosses a cattle guard and you've arrived.
