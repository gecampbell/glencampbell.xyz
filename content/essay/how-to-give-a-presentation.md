You've done the research, gathered the data, created your beautiful
charts and graphs, maybe even added a video or a soundtrack. Now
you have to take your precious
[PowerPoint](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx) or
[Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote) presentation and,
well, present it. You can either shine like the consummate professional
you are, or you can have all your hard work hidden behind a distracting
facade of blunders and missteps. Here's some of my top tips for
making sure that the presentation goes smoothly.

## Practice makes perfect

Actually, a better phrase is "Practice makes permanent, so always
practice perfect." It's astonishing to me how often someone will
give a presentation when it's obvious that they haven't looked at
it in months, if at all. Nothing reduces your credibility quite
like saying, "Huh, I didn't know that," when the slide of last
quarter's sales figures comes up on the screen. _Always_ make sure
you run through your slides in a rehearsal before you present, or
otherwise you'll look like a loon. A rehearsal, by the way, does
not mean merely skimming through and reading silently; you actually
need to plan on saying what you're going to say in the presentation
(see the next tip). When you rehearse, you should pretend that
you're actually presenting; make sure you allow time for questions,
and make sure that you know how long the presentation will take.
You look like a fool if you are on slide 31 of 60 when you've reached
the end of your allotted half-hour and there's a crowd of people
standing outside waiting to use the conference room. You should
know, within 10%, exactly how long your presentation takes.

## Don't read the fucking slides

Is there anything more annoying than having someone put up a slide
that says, "Sales increased in the last quarter," and then to say,
"Sales increased in the last quarter," as if the audience is composed
of fucking idiots who cannot read? If you're going to read the
fucking slide, then just create a PDF version and email it to
everyone at the meeting and save us all an hour.

## Use presentation mode

Every commercially-available presentation software has a mode for
editing or creating slides, and another one for presenting them.
If you're presenting, then put the damned thing in presentation
mode. I watched a presentation the other day where the presenter
kept it in edit mode the whole time, sometimes accidentally moving
text blocks off the screen while he was attempting to point out
things on the page.

## Turn off interruptions

Yes, I know you use Gtalk and Yahoo! IM and IRC and who knows what,
but turn them _off_ when you're presenting. You're trying to impress
people with your professionalism, not give them a laugh when your
best friend messages you during the meeting with, "Damn, I just
farted and the whole building smells bad." Turn off your cell phone.
You can't keep other people from interrupting you with their tinny
version of "Don't Stop Believing," but you don't have to inflict
that on everyone. Turn off your email notifications. Do you really
want, "New message: Are you as hot as I am right now?" popping up
during your presentation to the CFO?

## Don't turn off your screen

Seriously. Most people have their laptops set so that the screen
will go dark after some minutes of inactivity. It's quite common
to get involved answering a question, and then suddenly have the
screen go dark. It's hugely distracting; people's attention is
suddenly diverted to the now-dark screen while the presenter
frantically wiggles his or her mouse or trackpad, trying to get it
to come back on. With some projectors, it will take a minute or two
to warm back up again. If you have a Mac, get
[Caffeine](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/). This is a little
utility that looks like a coffee cup that sits in your menu bar.
Click it, and it will turn black, and your screen will no longer
automatically turn off. Click it again, and it will turn white, and
everything will work normally. I'm sure there's a similar utility
for Windows, or just right-click on the desktop and change the
screen settings to not automatically dim/turn off the screen.

## Be prepared

Finally, make sure you know how to connect your laptop to the
projector. If they projector uses a VGA connector and your laptop
has a DVI, then make sure you have an adapter. If your laptop and
presentation software supports dual screens, then make sure that
the presenter screen is on the laptop and the main presentation is
on the overhead screen. Arrive a few minutes early, if possible.
It's stupid and expensive to have a group of highly-paid professionals
sitting around while you impress them with your skills or lack
thereof in attempting to get everything working. If you follow all
these tips, praise and promotions are sure to follow.
