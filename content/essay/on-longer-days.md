Percussive sounds of rain<br>
Accompany whistling gusts<br>
That announce the arrival of a front.<br>
Coffee in the morning, solitary<br>
Browsing online, mist rising<br>
Above the rain-slicked vegetation<br>
And I think, "Bread."

Coffee requires toast.<br>
Toast requires thought, and<br>
Butter, and jam.<br>
Coffee, toast, and jam,<br>
On a rain-dark day, and this is<br>
The nothing that is more.

On Tuesday, the television craps<br>
And dismembers the news. Tanker<br>
Truck demolishes a family. Pixels are<br>
A falsehood on the screen; real flesh,<br>
Real blood, real mourning, screams<br>
That tear at throats and longer days<br>
With tears and loss and empty mornings<br>
Survived with coffee and no peace.

On Friday, the traffic increases,<br>
People fleeing town, somewhere<br>
Better lures them, hopes for<br>
A longer day, rain-slicked chairs,<br>
And coffee, perhaps, with toast<br>
And jam and maybe<br>
Eggs.
