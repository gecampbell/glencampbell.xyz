In the summer of 1969, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon. I watched
the fuzzy black and white images being broadcast live while
sleeping[^1] on my grandparents' living room floor. I heard the
words, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,"
about six seconds after he spoke them (allowing for various propagation
delays _en route_).

A few weeks later, we moved from our little house on 3185 Gilbert
to 545 Potter Dr., a much more upscale dwelling in the West End of
Beaumont. I started school that fall in Amelia Elementary, where I
was instantly designated "the new kid."

It was quite a change for me, socially. At Fehl (my prior elementary
school), I had been one of the "in crowd." Everyone wanted to be
friends with me, and I was very nearly the king of the playground.

The neighborhood around Fehl was definitely lower-middle class, but
everyone was friendly. Amelia was definitely upwardly-mobile,
middle-middle class, and no one had any clue at all who I was (nor
did they care). Of course, this analysis is based on much after-the-fact
looking back; at the time, I just knew that I had few friends and
certainly no longer stood out among my peers. I cannot comment on
the benefits provided by my relative anonymity.

I did well in classes, and the next few years went by in unmemorable
blandness. There was one major exception to the "unmemorable
blandness": in January, 1970, my church, Memorial Methodist, hosted
a _lay witness mission_.[^2]&nbsp;(A "lay witness mission" was an
evangelical movement or program, mostly Methodist, in which laypeople
would travel to another congregation and share their personal
"witness," or the story of their faith.) My parents, and indeed my
whole family, had been active church members until this point, but
this event marked a noticeable shift from mere church participation
to becoming more "evangelical" in their faith.

There were few immediate impacts on me with this change in my
parents' life. (I should also mention that the lay witness mission
also had a large impact on my brother Ted. It was there, I believe,
that he first felt the stirrings of a call to ministry that ultimately
resulted in his ordination as an Elder of the United Methodist
Church.)

We started attending a new church, Cathedral In The Pines Christian
Center, a church that was loosely affiliated with the Assembly of
God. We also acquired, slightly used, an Apache pop-up camping
trailer. We called it a "tent camper," but the pop-up sides were
actually ABS plastic, not canvas, so it was a bit more sturdy than
most of them. My father altered it to include an air conditioner
(mandatory for the Texas summers) and we used it all over the place
for many years.

We spent a number of summers on the frigid Guadalupe River near New
Braunfels, Texas. We rode inner tubes down the river from Canyon
Dam to our campsite, and I spent hours and hours fishing. My favorite
trick was to use a small hook with a light weight about a foot above
it. I would attach a hellgrammite to the hook through it's hard
collar and cast it towards a likely spot. The free line beyond the
weight would allow the hellgrammite to crawl around naturally, and
it would soon be attacked by a perch or trout, which I would then
hook and capture.

Hellgrammites are tough little critters; one afternoon, I caught
fourteen bluegill perch on a single bug. One day we left the trailer
at the campsite and went into San Antonio to visit the Alamo and
Brackenridge Park. When we returned to the campsite around 5PM that
evening, the entire lower end of the campsite was under about three
feet of water, including our campsite. We were filled with fear
that we had lost the trailer, but it turned out that the owners of
the campground had received notice of the water release from Canyon
Dam, and they attached our trailer to a truck and moved it elsewhere.
Things inside were somewhat disheveled, but it was all safe.

At the end of sixth grade, I joined Little League. Almost certainly
as a result of my father's influence (he was a die-hard baseball
fan, to the extent that he named two of his sons after baseball
players[^3]), I had developed a love for baseball. This was the
first opportunity I had to actually participate. I still remember
the tryouts; probably one of the most nerve-wracking events I have
ever been a part of.

I did reasonably well, and I was a pretty big kid, so I got selected
for a "senior-league" team. My best friend at the time (who had
convinced me to tryout), did _not_ make the senior league, and he
never spoke to me again. As a baseball player, I was enthusiastic
but, frankly, not very good. I can only remember getting a couple
of hits that season, and I was usually relegated to the depths of
left field. I do not recall how well the team did, and I only played
that one year.

The next autumn I started Middle School: a small step for some, but
a giant leap for me.

[^1]: Ok, I wasn't really sleeping. I was in a sleeping bag, it was night, it was late, and we were preparing to sleep. But not actually sleeping. Satisfied?
[^2]: I admit that I'm a bit perplexed. This is the first instance in my recent memory where Wikipedia failed to come up with a reference. There is no article on "lay witness missions" at all, but there are tons of other references on the web.
