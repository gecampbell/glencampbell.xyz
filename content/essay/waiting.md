I ran across this dog whilst wandering around South Lake Union
this afternoon. 
Seattle is a very dog-friendly town, and many businesses set out food and
water bowl for the four-legged residents. 
In this case, the dog was not neglected, but merely waiting on its
owner, who was inside a nearby restaurant.
