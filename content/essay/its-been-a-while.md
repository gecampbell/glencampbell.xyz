It appears that I have not really touched this site in the last 10 years,
apart from occasionally adding my opinions on 
[beer and cider](/essay/2023/05/cider-and-beer.html).
Thus, I have dusted off the old text editor, cleaned up my
[Github repositories](https://github.com/gecampbell?tab=repositories),
and basically resurrected it from the dead.

I've not been totally inactive, however. 
I have spent quite a bit of time working on my 
[photography website](https://glencampbell.photography). 
But even that has been dramatically updated recently. 
I suppose it's time for a spring cleaning.

I cannot and will not commit to regularly updating this site. 
I may come back to it from time to time.
