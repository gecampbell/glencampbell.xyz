I want to die in Autumn with my knees<br>
pulled up to my chin and fallen leaves<br>
crisp among the fading grass<br>
as night falls and constellations wax<br>
and the air grows cold; outside, wind slacks<br>
and fades, and people pass<br>
outside, unaware of the ending. Surprised,<br>
maybe, of the way it ends, my life,<br>
I grieve, of course, and mark<br>
the time to the minute. They<br>
have their lives; they can choose to say<br>
what they will, but dark<br>
is the ending, dark and cold and stale.<br>
There is light, too, pale<br>
gleams from distant points, and sounds<br>
of music (music! for all love) around<br>
and about and inside and out<br>
and joyful shouting and helpful hands.<br>
The end is the beginning, and stands,<br>
not separate, but entwined, routed<br>
between the knowing and the unknowing<br>
signs, that long tunnel leading<br>
from water into air.<br>
I'll arrive, knees bent, crying loud,<br>
fearful and joyful and tearful and<br>
hopeful and light of heart, where<br>
knowing and unknowing<br>
and becoming are one.
