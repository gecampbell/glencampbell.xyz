We're in the midst of annual reviews at my company; unlike some
companies, which schedule an annual review on the anniversary of
the employee's hire date, we do ours all at once, at the beginning
of the year. Part of the review process is "peer feedback;" that
is, each employee has the ability to request feedback from co-workers
on his or her performance throughout the year. In addition, each
employee creates a "self-assessment," where he or she analyzes his
or her own performance over the past year.

Having recently finished reading dozens of these, I'd like to share
what I find most helpful in a well-written peer or self assessment.
(Note: your company's process is most likely somewhat different
than mine, so feel free to adapt this to your particular situation.
I do think, however, that the general principles are common to most
business settings.)

The first rule of thumb is: **be on time!** A review or self-assessment
that arrives *before* my deadline for reporting on you is infinitely
more valuable than one that arrives later. When I have to tell my
manager about your performance, I'm going to have to rely on my
(imperfect) memory about your work if you don't give me your
self-assessment to remind me. Six sentences scrawled on the back
of an envelope (who uses envelopes any more, any way?) is far, far
better than a dozen pages that arrive 24 hours too late.

Second: **nouns are better than verbs.** Which of these sounds better?

1. Bob was an excellent performer whose efficient work was creative
   and elegant. _or_
2. During the First Widget project, Bob's design for the left-hand
   invigorator was delivered early and was used as an example for
   all the remaining invigorators.

The first one has glowing adjectives ("excellent," "efficient,"
"creative," etc.) but no details. The second example gives specific
examples of the work that Bob did to justify his performance.

When you write a review, think of specific examples and specific
value that the other employee (or yourself) has provided to the
company: "Jane solved the XYZ problem and saved the company $12
gazillion per year" is much better than "Jane's creativity was a
great benefit to the project."

Finally, **be honest.** The most common example of this is, "I can't
see any possible room for improvement in Jill's performance." Really?
Jill is absolutely perfect and cannot be improved in any way? What
that tells me is that you didn't take the review seriously enough
to put in a little effort to think about Jill's performance. Not
only does it give me nothing to discuss with Jill, it also reflects
badly on you.

Dishonesty appears in other guises as well: "Matthew was always an
eager participant at meetings." Superlatives like "always" are very
difficult to justify&mdash;maybe Matthew is an exception, and he _was_
"always an eager participant," but a few examples of his eagerness
would be better than an overeager statement like this that's difficult
to justify.
