In response to a wonderful thread on one of my favorite 
[mailing lists](/essay/2015/09/the-mailing-list.html),
here are a list of my favorite movies
(in no particular order).

* [Roman Holiday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046250/).
  Seriously, how much more fun can a movie be?
* [The Sound of Music](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/). 
  Surely everyone has this on their list.
* [The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167261/).
  I've been a Tolkien fan since early childhood and, while the entire
  LOTR trilogy is grand, the second movie from the set is truly
  magnificent. 
* [Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/)
  and [Part 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/). 
  Again, a series of movies that I've watched multiple times, 
  but these two in particular stand out. 
  [Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/) 
  is another great one.
* [Casablanca](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034583/). 
  Yes, I'll play it one more time, but for me.
* [Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083798/). 
  I'm a huge Steve Martin fan, but this movie combines old films
  and stupid humor like no other. 
* [Star Wars](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/). 
  Take a terrible director and producer, 
  a campy, mishmashed plot, and add in
  a pretentious, overly-complicated score, and what do you get?
  Pure movie magic.
  I saw it three times on opening day, and that boy in the rocket
  dropped that bomb down that tiny little hole ("a million-to-one shot")
  *every single time*. 
* [Being There](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078841/). 
  Oh. My. God. I have never laughed as hard at a movie as I did at this one.
  Yes, it hasn't aged well. 
  But Peter Sellers is still a comic genius. 
* [Local Hero](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085859/). 
  A small, charming movie, featuring Peter Riegert and a 
  pre-Doctor-Who Peter Capaldi, where every character 
  behaves contrary to what you expect (plus, there's a mermaid).

I'm sure there are others, and I'm sure that if I make another list tomorrow,
it will be different. But here's my list for today.
