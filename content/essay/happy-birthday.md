In April, 1991, lots of things were happening. My wife, Anita, was
pregnant with our first child (due at the end of May), and I had
two job offers in front of me. One was as a systems administrator
for the University of Texas Balcones Research Center, and the other
was a technical writer for [BMC Software](http://www.bmc.com).

I ended up accepting the BMC job, and scheduled my last day of work
(at the Texas Education Agency) for Wednesday, April 17, with a
start date on my new job of April 22. That gave me five days in
which to be unemployed; I planned on going fishing.

Plans were changed.

For several prior weeks, Anita had been having breathing difficulties.
The doctors who examined her thought that she was having problems
with her asthma, a known issue. On Tuesday, April 16, we had a
sonogram with our regular gynecologist. She referred us to a
specialist who examined her lungs. He determined that, in fact, she
didn't have asthma, but had a build-up of fluid in her lungs. He
prescribed a diuretic and sent us home.

The next morning, April 17, Anita was still having problems. Since
she wasn't up to going to work, I left her at her parents' house
while I went into the office to basically pack up my desk and get
ready to move out. Anita's parents had business to take care of in
west Texas, so they left to spend the night in Junction, TX, about
200 miles away from Austin.

When I reached work, I had a message waiting from the gynecologist.
She told me that, after reviewing Anita's case, she was growing
concerned. Anita had, as she put it, "a lot of little problems,
none of which by itself was terribly bad, but, when put together,
was a cause for concern." So I basically threw everything on my
desk into a box, said a hasty goodbye.

I picked Anita up from her parents' house, told her what the
gynecologist had said, and we drove to Seton Medical Center.  They
admitted her and put her into a room on the maternity ward. That
afternoon and evening was a series of tests, x-rays, and just plain
observation. I honestly don't remember a lot of what went on.

During the night, Anita's condition worsened; I had set up a folding
cot in her room, and I remember her being taken for a chest x-ray
at 2:00 o'clock in the morning. Around 3 o'clock, the gynecologist
told me that she had, in essence, decided to take the baby early.
The sonogram from the day before showed that the baby was about
five pounds. Her decision, she said, was whether to take the baby
now (at 3 a.m.), or to wait for the morning when a full staff would
be available. She wanted to wait for the staff to arrive, of course,
but she might have to operate sooner if Anita's blood oxygen level
dropped below 85%.

If you're familiar with this, a blood oxygen level of 98% is normal;
anything below 95% is bad, and it's really rare for someone to drop
below 90%. At this point, Anita was on 100% oxygen, and she appeared
to be pretty stable.

The decision was made to wait until morning so that a full staff
would be available. Around 8AM, I called friends and family from
work and let them know what was happening. I held Anita's hand as
they moved her bed into the elevator to go down to the operating
room, then went up to the waiting area on the maternity floor (I
was not allowed to be present during the surgery).

Our friend Glenda showed up a few minutes later, and we waited
together until a nurse came up to tell us what was going on. The
C-section went well, and Elam was taken to the neonatal ICU (on the
top floor of the hospital), while Anita went to the cardiac ICU (in
the basement). Since we couldn't go to Anita's ICU, we went upstairs
and met Elam for the first time.

Neonatal ICU has a very strict rules; you have to scrub your hands
(and arms) for about five minutes before you put on scrubs and are
allowed to go in. We finally washed up, and arrived in time to see
him pee all over the nurse. "Well, we know that his plumbing is
working," she said.

In the neonatal ICU, Elam was doing well. He had had some breathing
troubles initially; they told me, however, that this was not uncommon
in C-section babies. Typically, the compression of a normal birth
helped to push a lot of the fluid out of the lungs. Once his lungs
cleared up a bit, he was fine, though a bit small. He initially
weighed about five pounds; the day after he was born, he dropped
down to around 4 pounds, 9 ounces (again, this is commonly caused
by fluid loss and wasn't a real cause for concern).

Once we verified that Elam was fully functional, Glenda and I went
downstairs to see how Anita was doing. The short answer was: not
good.

Once they let us into the cardiac/pulmonary ICU, we were escorted
to her room. At the time we arrived, they were trying to take her
off the respirator. I can recall seeing her thrashing around on the
bed, her eyes frantically flickering around the room, and the monitor
over her head indicated that her blood pressure was 295/180. Various
alarms were going off, and it seemed like there were a dozen doctors
and nurses in her room. The OBGYN saw me and hurriedly moved me
back towards the waiting room.

Her initial explanation was that Anita &quot;wasn't coming off the
vent [respirator] very well,&quot; and that the team of doctors had
decided to let her &quot;rest for a while.&quot; Basically, they
left her with the ventilator in place, put her on sedatives and
Trachrium (a muscle relaxant), and left her to sleep for a while.

At some point, [my brother Mark](/essay/2011/03/goodbye-bro.html)
had arrived from San Antonio. Since Anita's ICU only allowed visitors
every two or three hours (and then only for 15 minutes), he drove
me home so that I could take a shower and change clothes. The rest
of that day is still somewhat vague in my memory.

The next few days were a blur; visiting Anita (when allowed) in the
basement, and Elam in the neonatal unit. On the Saturday after the
birth, Anita had an "event"&mdash;Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS). This is where, because of the ventilator, the longs lose
their elasticity and have trouble functioning. Luckily, one of the
premier pneumatologists in the area was present, and he was able
to adjust the ventilator.

Once past that crisis, she improved markedly, until she was able
to be removed from the ventilator and moved to a private room, and
ultimately discharged. Elam stayed in the neonatal unit for another
few days, and he finally came home about two weeks after being born.
