I inherited my geekiness about gadgets from my father. You might
not expect an infatuation with small electronic devices (what I
call "gadgets") from a person who was born in 1926 and raised in
the rural part of southeast Texas, but he always showed a fascination
with equipment like that. He was, after all, trained as a quartermaster
in the Navy. Plus, he was an avid amateur photographer at a time
when personal cameras were not all that common.

We have a picture of him, taken sometime during the end of WWII,
his shirt off, drying rolls of some film on the deck of his Navy
ship.[^1] The film is unusual; certainly much bigger then 35mm, it
also appears to be much longer than the average roll of 6.5cm film
(which is usually only a dozen or so shots). This looks like there
could easily be fifty images in the 6.5 or 4.5cm format.

We were the first family in the neighborhood to get
[Pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), and we were the first
people we knew to get a VHS video camera. He encouraged my interest
in electronics and that interest is almost certainly the reason
that I have the career that I do.

For me, however, it all started at the Christmas of my 7th grade
year when I received a very early Texas Instruments calculator.[^2]
With this astoundingly expensive gift (the retail price was $149.99
at the time), I was the envy of all of my school friends. With this
magical[^3] device, I could take the square root of a number without
tedious calculations. Sadly, I no longer have the SR-10, but I now
own a collection of high-end calculators that I've acquired through
the years.

I wrote some of my first computer programs not on a "computer" _per
se_, but on a programmable calculator.[^4] I may be one of the few
people who moved from calculators to the slide rule, and not vice
versa; in high school, as a freshman, I joined the University
Interscholastic League[^5] slide rule team. By the time I was a
senior, however, the slide rule competition had been dropped in
favor of a mathematics competition that permitted the use of a
calculator.

I was one of the first people to acquire the original Palm Pilot,
and I've certainly kept up with the gadgets through the years. To
me, it is fascinating to see how much power can be held in the palm
of your hand. While most of us take such things for granted, it's
worthwhile to pause occasionally and reflect that our smartphone
has more raw computing power than existed on the entire earth in
1970.

Imagine if people of that era could see the astounding things we
do with so much power at our fingertips: Angry Birds! Facebook!
Twitter! With all seriousness, however, we have so much power
available to us at so little a price that we can afford to spend
much of it on games and amusements.
