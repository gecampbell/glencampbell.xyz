Like many people in technology-related careers, I have long searched
for the perfect carrying bag. Ideally, I would like to have a bag
or backpack that can hold a weeks' worth of clothes, a full-size
desktop computer and monitor, spare printer and paper, my camera
and extra lenses, a full-size MIDI keyboard, and a small swimming
pool, and still weigh under 2 lbs. when fully loaded.

Needless to say, such a device has not been developed yet, so I
keep trying various luggage-type devices to see how close I can
get.

This is a [Lands' End](http://www.landsend.com) *Square Rigger*
attach&eacute; that I acquired around 1989.  At that time in the
remote past, portable computers did not really exist, and I used
the case for mostly transporting notebooks, pens, and paper, to and
from my work.

When I finally acquired a laptop for work, I also acquired the first
of many laptop bags. I don't recall all the details, but I'm sure
it was heavily padded and weighed a ton, because the laptop computers
at the time were around 12 lbs.  The Square Rigger was set aside,
and a succession of laptops and their carrying apparatus followed,
usually of ever-increasing sizes.

Around 1999, I reached my personal baggage capacity. At that time,
I was using a [Lowepro](http://www.lowepro.com) photographer's
backpack. It could carry a full-sized SLR camera and 3-4 lenses in
addition to the *de rigeur* 15-lb. laptop computer. At that time,
I was commuting weekly to a job in Wuppertal, Germany, from my home
in Ascot, England. I was seriously starting to have back problems,
too.

However, technology kept advancing, and laptops started to get
smaller and smaller, and my later bags (usually backpacks) also
started to get to a more reasonable size. In 2010, I acquired an
11" [MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) which was so
light and thin that [it wasn't even considered a laptop by the
TSA](http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/11/macbook-airs-along-with-many-other.html).
The bag, however, was still fairly large.

These days, I occasionally use the 11" MacBook Air, but I'm usually
commuting with an [iPad Mini](http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/overview/).
The other day, I ran across my 25-year-old Square Rigger attach&eacute;
and realized that it was just perfect. I usually commute with the
iPad and occasionally throw in some connectors, business cards,
and, on rare occasions, the laptop. The velcro on the outside had
worn out, so I went to a local shop that does alterations and had
it replaced.  No, it's not heavily padded, but I can put the MacBook
air in a padded sleeve when I need to carry it. While it doesn't
meet my description of the perfect bag (above), it's amazing to me
that the miniaturization of electronics has allowed me to bring
these older artifacts back into play.
