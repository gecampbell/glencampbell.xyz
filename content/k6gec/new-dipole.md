We're expecting the [new radio](http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-9420) to arrive today so, in preparation for that, we ran the antenna cable out through the dog door to our wee little dipole antenna. For now, it's only a few feet off the ground, but we're hopeful that it should work for testing. Plus, we hope to operate it remotely in a week or so; this will make it easier to pack up when it's time to move.
