We've got our little MFJ-9420 (20M) transceiver set up. We have the antenna strung as an inverted-V over some trees in the back yard. We have the antenna tuned to a SWR between 1:1.1 and 1:1.3.

And yet, apart from one QSO where I snuck up on someone in Arizona (thus proving that a signal is getting out and getting heard), I'm getting no responses to calling CQ.

None.

Zip.

Zilch.

Nada.

After several weeks of trying regularly.

Yes, it only puts out 10W or thereabouts, and I suspect that's the main issue; our signal is getting lost in the noise for most folks.

But, really, nothing at all? It's very frustrating.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.
