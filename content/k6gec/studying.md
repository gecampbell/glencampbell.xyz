I currently hold a Technician class license that I acquired in 2006 (after the FCC dropped the code requirement). I'm hoping to upgrade that this weekend, however, by taking the General class examination offered by <a href="http://www.w5ros.org">W5ROS</a> here in San Antonio.

To prepare for this, I've been using the awesome <a href="https://hamstudy.org">Ham Study</a> site. It allows you to review the questions, go through randomly-selected flash cards, and take practice tests. In addition, it's smart enough so that, if you miss a question, it will bring it up more frequently until you get it right a few times in a row.

<!--more-->Moreover, if you create an account and sign in, it will remember your status over time so that you know how much you've covered.

As you can see, I started off poorly, but my recent tests have been at 94%, so I'm hopeful of doing well on Saturday.
