Today is [ARRL Field Day](http://arrl.org/fieldday). This is an event *cum* contest: the idea is to operate remotely so as to simulate operating under emergency conditions. It's also a contest, in that you attempt to make as many points as possible with other folks. It's also a public-relations events, where groups permit interested folks to get on the air under proper supervision.

_This is my field day setup. If you look closely, you can see the center point of my dipole over the truck in the back._

I'm operating at my wife's family's ranch in west Texas. I guess I should be operating on battery power, but it was easier just to plug in the power supply.

I put up my dipole between two large trees in the yard, and the reception is fantastic! I've already had a lot more success talking with other hams in California, Vermont, and Idaho, than I ever had at home. (I'm now convinced that my home problems are because the antenna is too low and blocked by a hill to the north.)
