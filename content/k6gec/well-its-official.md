The [FCC Universal Licensing System](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls) (ULS) has been updated, and I am now officially a General class licensee.

In addition, my announcement of passing the exam last week stimulated a friend of mine to go out and get his license on Saturday. He had a background in engineering, so it was fairly trivial for him to pass his Technician exam, and I encouraged him to go for his General as well, and he passed that, too! Moreover, that got my son interested, so he's been studying and will (probably) take his Technician exam this coming Saturday.
