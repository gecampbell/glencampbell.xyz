The [MFJ-9420](http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-9420) is one of the low-cost radios that we've been looking at, now that we have access to the HF frequencies. My son and I found this video last night and it helped us to learn a lot.

The video is part of a series put together by David Savidge at [AF5DN on air](http://af5dn.com). His website has a ton of useful stuff there.

I have questions, however:

* How important is it to have an antenna tuner?
* Is it dangerous to the radio to use, say, a tuned dipole at the end of a very long coax without the tuner?
* If I get a small antenna tuner like the one shown, will it be useful with other radios?
* Since I've never worked HF before, is 5-9 watts sufficient, or should I save my nickels for a more powerful (100w) unit?
