After much more intensive study at [hamstudy.org](http://hamstudy.org), I managed to pass my Amateur Extra examination today with a score of 45/50. No more exams, ever!

My son also took his exam today and passed both the Technician and General elements.

We are both looking forward to our new licenses in the mail from the FCC in a couple of weeks.
