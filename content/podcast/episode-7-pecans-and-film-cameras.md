My guest this week is a serious amateur photographer from Las Cruces, New Mexico, who raises pecans and loves sharing his landscape photography online. You can find Linc's online portfolio [here](http://contaxg.com/user.php?id=3570). [My apologies   there are some audio quality problems; I hope it's still enjoyable.]
