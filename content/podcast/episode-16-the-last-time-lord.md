My guest this week is either a comic artist or she isn't. She's a fan of pop culture except for the parts she doesn't like. And she's pretty much in love with anything Joss Whedon touched. She's stimulating, intellectual, and can move through time in her Tardis. Find her [on FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/amberspence).
