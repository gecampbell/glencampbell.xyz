In honor of Memorial Day, this episode of On Garner Road consists
of a recording of a conversation I had with my father in 2008 about
his experiences surrounding World War II. Oddly enough, it starts
with an account of the "race riots" in Beaumont, Texas, when, as a
member of the National Guard, he was required to protect downtown
Beaumont from what was, essentially, a lynch mob.

An "LST," by the way, is a "Landing Ship Tank," one of the amphibious
craft used by the US Navy to deploy tanks on Pacific beaches. My
dad is not perfect, of course, but I'm extremely proud of his service
and, more importantly, of his life. He's still around and helping
to care for my mother, who is in the long, slow decline of Alzheimer's.

They still live in Beaumont, Texas, so perhaps this isn't entirely
appropriate for a "memorial" day, but, given the sacrifices of those
who have gone before him, I'm willing to forego strict accuracy.
Sadly, some of this conversation has been lost, but I hope you enjoy
what remains. And I hope you take a moment today to give thanks for
those soldiers whose sacrifices meant so much to so many.

**Update:** My father passed away on July 27, 2011. His funeral was
attended by full military honors. My mother followed him shortly
thereafter, on September 30 of the same year.
