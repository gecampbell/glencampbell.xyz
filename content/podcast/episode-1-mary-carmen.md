My guest this week is a librarian with a fondness for Italian meat who moved from New York to North Carolina. She's well known to the [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/) crowd, but deserves to be introduced to the rest of the Internet. You can follow her on [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/marycarmen) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pigsinspace). Her blog is called [Circ and Serve](http://circandserve.wordpress.com/). This episode was recorded on March 19, 2010.
