My guest this week is a social media and marketing consultant who lives in Austin, Texas. She has her hand in so many projects that it's hard to keep track of them all, but she remains focused on helping people and businesses connect (and she also spills the beans on how  [Apple](http://www.apple.com) uses social media). She also has time to discuss poetry and her favorite Mexican and Japanese restaurants in Austin. You can follow her on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Orchid8) or [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/Orchid8), as well as numerous other places with the Orchid8 handle. This episode was recorded on March 24, 2010.
