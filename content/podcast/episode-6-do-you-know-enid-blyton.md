My guest this week is a transplanted Mancunian living in British Columbia with strong opinions on writing, creativity, social media, and science fiction.   She prefers the term "geek" rather than "nerd." Follow her on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/worldofhiglet) or [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/worldofhiglet).
