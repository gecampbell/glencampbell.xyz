John Piercy is a firefighter from Ontario who has developed a passion for digital photography in the last few years. Surprisingly, he's not much of a hockey fan (surprising to me, at least). You can follow him on [FriendFeed](http://friendfeed.com/johnpiercy) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/johncpiercy). This episode was recorded on March 20, 2010.
