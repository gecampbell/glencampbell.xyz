"Can you smell it from your house?" My guest this week is Mona Nomura, a highly-influential social media maven, currently working at the manager of Social Media Marketing at [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com). She was at one time known at "The Queen of FriendFeed," and she's one of the friendliest people you'll ever meet. You can follow her on the web on [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/monanomura) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mona).
