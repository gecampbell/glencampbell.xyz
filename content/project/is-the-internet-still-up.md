I know that you, like me, have often wondered whether or not the
Internet is still running. Now you need worry no more. I have created
the Internet status page:

<http://internet-status.info>

Simply point your browser to this site, and it will let you know
if the Internet is still up after running an exhaustive series of
checks, including verifying every single intermediate node (router,
firewall, proxy, or cache) between your browser and the Internet.

Available in multiple languages based on your system's language
settings.
